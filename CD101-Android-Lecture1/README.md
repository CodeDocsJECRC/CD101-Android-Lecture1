# Q1. Staircase Pattern
Consider a staircase of size n = 4:
	   #
	  ##
	 ###
	####

Observe that its base and height are both equal to n, and the image is drawn using # symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces. 
Write a program that prints a staircase of size n.

## Input Format
A single integer, n , denoting the size of the staircase.

## Output Format
Print a staircase of size n using # symbols and spaces.

## Note: The last line must have 0 spaces in it. 


# Q2. Maximum and Minimum
Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. 
Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

## Input Format
A single line of five space-separated integers.

## Constraints
Each integer is in the inclusive range [1...10^9].

## Output Format
Print two space-separated long integers denoting the respective minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers.
(The output can be greater than a 32 bit integer.)

## Sample Input
1 2 3 4 5

## Sample Output
10 14


# Q3. Multiples of 3 and 5
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below N. 

## Input Format
First line contains T that denotes the number of test cases. This is followed by T lines, each containing an integer, N.

## Constraints
- T lies in range 1 to 10^5
- N lies in range 1 to 10^9

## Output Format
For each test case, print an integer that denotes the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below N.  

## Sample Input 
2
10
100

## Sample Output 
23
2318

## Explanation 
For N = 10, if we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiple of 3 or 5, we get 3,5,6,9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
